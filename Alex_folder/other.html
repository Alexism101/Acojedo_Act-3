         I discovered the game Dota in the world of millennials when I was just 8 years old or younger.
            I knew nothing about it and didn't have a world of my own regarding games. I would often watch 
                it at the computer shop whenever I was told to buy BBQ outside our house. I watched the game 
                    because it was so captivating, and I couldn't express how much I loved it. However, I knew
                         to myself that when I grew up, I would play this game because of its amazing mechanics and gameplay.

        I've been playing chess for a long time, and I started when I was still a kid, probably in Grade 1. 
             My dad was always my opponent. I was so eager to play that before we'd start, I'd massage his feet. I
              got used to playing and gradually improved my skills, even beating students who participated in division-level
                 competitions. Unfortunately, I didn't make it to higher-level tournaments, and I often underestimated my opponents,
                     thinking it would be easy to beat them. However, I was wrong, as they had more experience and had played many more games 
                          than I had. I stopped playing from Grade 1 to Grade 4. I picked up the game again during the pandemic (2020-2021), but now
                            it's just a hobby of mine.

        I consider these games as the most strategic games for me. If we're talking about games that don't originate from technology or computers, I would
          say that chess is one of them because it involves calculation and defensive strategy. The same goes for Dota. That's why these two games are the ones
             I always play, before and as technology continues to evolve. I can still see the similarity between the two.
