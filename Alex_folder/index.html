    <h3>Little <br>
Information</h3>
<p>My name is Alexander D. Acojedo. 22 years old and my birthday is May 29, 2003.
    I studied different schools as an Elementary, High school, and Senior high school student.
     Not in relationship and single. I got a height of about 155 cm or 5'1 ft.  
        Brown skin and not really skinny and not really buffed. 
            I like to eat seafood aside from fish, like shrimp, shells, and seaweed. 
                Loves to listen to different genres of music, like romantic, slowed, and rap, and at the same time, calm.
</p>
<h3>Hobbies and <br>Talents</h3>
<p>I have the ability to create animations. I have the ability also to create comics 
    and can compose a song as well. I can make a portrait, sketch or even a realism art. 
        I tried and always try to play music in any different kinds of instruments. 
            I refuse dancing and acting but, I have the hobby of singing. 
                 I love to play games such as bato-lata, hide and seek, and bahay kubo as an outdoor games. 
                    And in computer games, I love to play Dota, and Roblox as well.

 </p>
 <h3>Pet Peeves and <br> Adoptables</h3>
 <p>
    I automatically can't be proud when someone normalizes going to bars and clubs. 
         No deal with those who chose war over peace. 
             I don't appreciate those people who throw their trashes away.
                I hate those who have no respect in general terms.
                     I'll dispose those people who shows no kindess in all living things. 
                        On the other hand, I congratulate people who lower their patience always.  
                            I love those people who put GOD first. I like those people who understands and have a emotional intelligence. 
                                I will always choose to go to the person who always listens and doesn't insist on their same experience when 
                                    someone is sharing in front of them.

 <h3>Why I chose <br> BSIT?</h3>
 <p>
    First of all, BSIT is not my dream course. BSIT is in the list of the courses that I want to choose when I go to college.
         My first course I want to take is Fine Arts then next Architectural, next Physcology down to Philosphy and lastly BSIT. 
            I picked BSIT course since I found out that I have an interest of games. How games are created? what course to take when
                 creating games? since my childhood, I use to draw something and make it a game with my friends in my Elementary days.
                     we are all busy in making it up and put some updates even though its just a drawing. And now, I found that BSIT has 
                        the ability to create everything inside a computer, considering games. I know BSIT is not that easy as I expected before. 
                            BSIT is so broad you can only chose one way much better. You can be a person called "FULL STACK DEVELOPER." But again,
                                 many sacrifices and deadly moments will happen first before reaching the top.
