                            There are many more moments I didn't mention here. We had a blast,
                                 bonding together and momentarily forgetting our individual problems.
                                     These memories will forever be etched in the minds of my friends. We 
                                        shared laughter, sang songs, and yes, there were drinks involved. Most
                                             of these photos were taken in almost the same location.

                      <h4 style="color: hotpink; text-align: left;">and the names of the people in the photos are:</h4>
                        <ul style="color: azure;">
                            <li>Ken</li>
                            <li>Christ</li>
                            <li>James</li>
                            <li>Chris</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="color: cornsilk;">
                            I don't know some of them because they were with my other friends. They're basically friends of my friends. <br>
                                 Almost every photo you'll see is by the sea because we wanted to have a nature trip at least once a year if possible.
                                     We won't forget the moments where we made time for each other, caught up, exchanged gifts, and more. We also hope that 
                                          next time, we'll have an even bigger and more fun gathering."
